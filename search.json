    "section": "",
    "text": "Whether a team’s ultimate score in the Elite Eight is correlated with the amount of assists they record is a subject that coaches,fans, and analysts alike are asking asking as the 2024 NCAA Women’s Basketball Tournament approaches its end. Assists have a reputation as indicators of a good team play and offensive cooperation, but how do they relate to the outcome of games at such a high level of competition? We will explore the relationship between assists and final score, compare winning teams’ assists with losing teams, and find the distribution of assists for winning and losing teams.\n\nThe Importance of Assists in Women’s Basketball\nIn women’s basketball, like any sport, teamwork is an essential part of the sport. A team’s ability to share the ball, provide teammates with opportunities, and maintains offensive flow. If a team has a high assist total, it generally indicates that a team is communicates effectively, which leads to better offensive execution and higher percentage shots.With examining the data, we can evaluate if there is a relationship between a team’s ultimate score and amount of assists they produce and find any trends.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse) \nlibrary(ggplot2)\nelite &lt;- read.csv(\"dataproject/2024_elite_eight_wbb.csv\")\n\neliteclean &lt;- elite[,c(\"game_id\",\"team_name\",\"team_score\",\"assists\",\"team_winner\")]\n\n\nggplot(eliteclean, aes(x = assists, y = team_score, color = team_winner)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.7, size = 3) +\n  geom_smooth(method = 'lm', color = 'red', linetype = \"dashed\",se=FALSE, size = 1.2) + \n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"TRUE\" = \"purple\", \"FALSE\" = \"green\"),\n  labels=c(\"TRUE\"=\"Win\",\"FALSE\"=\"Loss\")\n  ) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Assists vs. Results: Does Playmaking Predict Wins in the 2024 Women's Elite Eight?\",\n    subtitle = \"The &lt;span style='color:red;'&gt;red&lt;/span&gt; dashed line represents the linear regression fit, showing the general trend between the number of assists and the final team score.\",\n    x = \"Assists\",\n    y = \"Team Score\",\n    caption = \"By: Aliscyn Hammond | Source: Whoop\",\n    color = \"Team Outcome\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = ggtext::element_markdown(size = 12, lineheight = 1.2, hjust = 0.5),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 14),\n    axis.text = element_text(size = 12),\n    plot.caption = element_text(size = 10, hjust = 1),\n    legend.position = \"top\",  # Move legend to top\n    legend.title = element_text(size = 12),\n    legend.text = element_text(size = 10)\n  ) +\n  theme(panel.grid.major = element_line(color = \"gray\", size = 0.5),\n        panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n          plot.title.position = \"plot\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe scatterplot displays the relationship between the teams’ final scores and the number of assists they received in the 2024 Women’s Elite Eight. While there is a general upward trend indicating that teams with more assists score higher, the plot also reveals variability, with some teams having high assists numbers yet failing to score well.\n\n\nHow Do Winning Teams Compare to Losing Teams in Assists?\nWe may then contrast the average number of assists scored by winning and losing teams. It may indicate that winning teams are more proficient at providing opportunities for one another, which results in more effective scoring, if they have greater average assist totals.\n\n\nCode\n#| message: FALSE\n#| warning: FALSE\n#| \nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nelite &lt;- read.csv(\"dataproject/2024_elite_eight_wbb.csv\")\n\navg_assists &lt;- elite |&gt;\n  group_by(team_winner) |&gt;\n  summarise(avg_assists=mean(assists,na.rm=TRUE))\nelite &lt;- elite %&gt;%\n  mutate(team_status = ifelse(team_winner == TRUE, \"Winning\", \"Losing\"))\n\n\nggplot(elite, aes(x = team_display_name, y = assists, fill = team_status)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", position = \"dodge\") +\n  geom_hline(data = avg_assists, aes(yintercept = avg_assists, color = factor(team_winner)), linetype = \"dashed\", size = 1, color = \"black\") +  \n  labs(\n    title = \"Assists vs. Outcomes: Elite Eight Playmaking Breakdown\",\n    subtitle = paste(\"Black dashed lines show average assists among Winning and Losing Teams.\"),\n    x = \"Team\",\n    y = \"Assists\",\n    caption = \"By: Aliscyn Hammond | Source: Whoop\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  scale_fill_manual(\n    values = c(\"blue\", \"red\"), \n    labels = c(\"Winning\", \"Losing\")  \n  ) +\n  scale_color_manual(\n    values = c(\"blue\", \"red\") \n  ) +  \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 12, face = \"italic\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 12, face = \"bold\"),\n     axis.title.x = element_text(size = 14, face = \"bold\", hjust = 0.5, vjust = -1),\n    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1, size = 9),  \n    axis.text.y = element_text(size = 10),\n    panel.grid = element_blank(),\n    legend.title = element_blank(), \n    legend.position = \"top\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile winning teams generally had higher average assists, there wasn’t a clear correlation between assists and victory. Some teams with high assists still lost, showing that assists alone do not ensure success.Assists are important for creating scoring opportunities which benefit the team, but do not guarantee that those opportunities will get converted into points. For example, if a team struggles with shooting accuracy or commit turnovers, their high assists might not translate into a win which is why we see some lack thereof in teams that have high assists, but lost. Conversely, some teams that won with fewer assists may have relied heavily on individual performances or a strong defense, which allowed them to overcome their lower assist totals.\n\n\nAssists Distribution: A More Deeper Look into Variability\nNow let’s explore the distribution of assists among winning and losing teams in greater detail. Instead of merely focusing on the averages, we can analyze the spread of assists within each group/team. Do winning teams consistently excel at ball distribution, or do their assist figures fluctuate more than anticipated. Utilizing a boxplot will allow us to visualize the range of assists with highlighting the median, quartiles, and if there are any possible outliers.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nggplot(elite, aes(x = factor(team_winner, labels = c(\"Losing\", \"Winning\")), y = assists, fill = team_winner)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  labs(title = \"The Assist Divide: A Boxplot Analysis of Elite Eight Winners vs. Losers\",\n       x = \"Team Status\",\n       y = \"Assists\",\n       caption = \"By: Aliscyn Hammond | Source:  Whoop\") +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"red\", \"green\")) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe boxplot analysis of assists of winning and losing teams highlights that while winning teams tend to have a greater range of assists, the median number of assists is similar for both groups, suggesting that assists alone are not definitive predictor of victory. Interestingly, some losing teams still record high assists, showing that assists alone are not enough to guarantee a win. Additionally, the longer tail for winning teams suggests that some teams with very high assists were more successful, but overall, there is significant variability in how assists influence the outcome of the game.\nWhile assists are a vital part of basketball and correlate with team scoring, they do not guarantee victory. Some losing teams record high assists, indicating the ball movement alone is not enough to win. The variability we have seen shows that the assist distribution of both winning and losing teams suggests that winning is determined by broader set of factors, including but not limited to, shooting accuracy, turnovers, defense, and ability to execute under pressure. The analysis of assists in the 2024 Women’s Elite Eight provides a glimpse into how team play influences game outcomes, but it also reinforces the idea that basketball is a multi-faceted sport. Success on the court depends not just on assists but on all variety of elements working together. By exploring additional data and using statistical techniques, anyone can gain a deeper understanding of the complex nature of sport performance and truly find the true drivers of success."
