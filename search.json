    "section": "",
    "text": "In the world of women’s college basketball, few players have captured the attention of fans like Paige Bueckers and Caitlin Clark. Both players have become household names, known for their incredible skills and leadership on the court. From their early years in college to their rise as dominant forces, tracking the growth of Bueckers and Clark offers a fascinating glimpse into their evolution as athletes. I will take a closer look at how these two athletes have developed, comparing their freshman, sophomore, and junior seasons, and analyzing key statistics that highlight their growth. By examining their performance over the years, we’ll explore how they’ve refined their games, faced challenges, and emerged as two of the brightest stars in women’s basketball.\n\nComparing The Scoring Evolution of Bueckers and Clark\nOver the course of their careers in college basketball, Caitlin Clark and Paige Bueckers have seen some remarkable changes in scoring. Both have risen dramatically, with some plateaus, due to a number of factors including injuries and evolving roles on their teams or just off seasons. Plotting the pair’s points per game from 2020 to their recent season in 2024 illustrates these trends, providing a better view of who has taken the most significant leaps in their scoring and when those changes happened.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(dplyr)\npc&lt;- read.csv(\"databball/pc_basketball.csv\")\n\npb &lt;- pc |&gt; filter(Player==\"Paige Bueckers\")\ncc&lt;- pc |&gt;  filter(Player==\"Caitlin Clark\")\n\npb$Date &lt;- as.Date(pb$Date, format = \"%Y-%m-%d\")  \ncc$Date &lt;- as.Date(cc$Date, format = \"%Y-%m-%d\")\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_step(data = pb, aes(x = Date, y = PTS, group = Player, color = \"Paige Bueckers\")) + \n  geom_step(data = cc, aes(x = Date, y = PTS, group = Player, color = \"Caitlin Clark\")) + \n  labs(\n    x = \"Season\",\n    y = \"Points Per Game\",\n    title = \"Caitlin Clark's Dominance Over Bueckers' Growth\",\n    subtitle = \"Paige was sidelined by injury for an entire season, while Caitlin's scoring soared each year.\",\n    caption = \"Source:https://www.sports-reference.com | By: Aliscyn Hammond \"\n  ) +\n  scale_x_date(date_breaks = \"1 year\", date_labels = \"%Y\") +\n  scale_color_manual(\n    values = c(\"Paige Bueckers\" = \"#e4002b\",\n               \"Caitlin Clark\" = \"#FFCD00\")\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 12, face = \"italic\"),\n    axis.title.x = element_text(size = 11),\n    axis.title.y = element_text(size = 11),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\",\n    plot.subtitle.position = \"plot\",\n    legend.title = element_blank(),\n    legend.text = element_text(size = 10,face=\"italic\"),\n    plot.caption = element_text(size = 9, hjust = 2.3)\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThrough the years, one could see the constant uphill climb in Caitlin Clark’s development towards becoming a consistent scorer. Since her early seasons, Clark had shown much skill, and over time those points per game rose quite gradually. By challenging herself every season, she set in concrete her status as one of the most dominant scorer’s in women’s college basketball. Her senior year found her at the height of her scoring ability, continuing to evolve and adapt to the competition while maintaining a high level of performance throughout her career.\nPaige Bueckers, on the other hand, faced a unique set of challenges that impacted her scoring trajectory. After starting her career with impressive numbers, she had back to back injuries, for her only to discover that she would be sidelined for her junior season. Which is why for Bueckers, she had no Points Per Game (PPG) during 2023. Remarkably, Bueckers came back for her senior year. After a year-long recovery, she came back into form immediately and put up impressive scoring numbers, nearly meeting Clark’s collective of PPG. The ability to bounce back after such a significant break speaks volumes about her determination and skill, proving that she could still compete at the highest level despite the adversity she faced. She did decide to stay another year at UConn, I am interested to see how her PPG this coming season will compare to Caitlin’s last year in college basketball.\n\n\nTotal Contributions: Key Stat Comparisons Across Seasons\nNow, I want to take a closer look at the total contributions of Caitlin Clark and Paige Bueckers across their careers, focusing on key statistical comparisons. By examining their performance over the seasons, we can gain a deeper understanding of how each player impacts the game beyond just scoring. The stacked chart provides a comprehensive view of their contributions in various areas, offering a detailed comparison of their overall influence on the court as they progressed through their collegiate careers.\n\n\nCode\npc_long &lt;- pc %&gt;%\n  gather(key= \"Stat\",value=\"Value\",PTS,AST,TRB,STL)\n\nggplot(pc_long,aes(x=Season,y=Value,fill=Stat))+\n  geom_bar(stat=\"identity\",position=\"stack\")+\n  facet_wrap(~Player)+\n  labs(\n    title=\"Clark Leads in Every Stat, Bueckers' Comeback Across the Board\",\n    subtitle=\"Clark dominated stats while Bueckers bounced back after a season off.\",\n    caption=\"Source: https://www.sports-reference.com | By: Aliscyn Hammond\",\n    x=\"Season\",\n    y=\"Total Performance\",\n    fill=\"Stat Category\"\n  )+\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"PTS\" = \"#7C878E\",\n                                \"AST\" = \"#000e2f\",\n                               \"TRB\" = \"#e4002b\",\n                               \"STL\" = \"#FFCD00\"),\n                     labels = c(\"Points\" ,\n                                \"Assists\",\n                                \"Total Rebounds\",\n                                \"Steals\")) +\n  theme_minimal()+\n  theme(axis.text.x =element_text(angle=45,hjust=1),\n        plot.title =element_text(size=15,face=\"bold\"),\n        plot.subtitle =element_text(size=13,face=\"italic\"),\n        axis.title.x =element_text(size=14),\n        axis.title.y =element_text(size=14),\n        axis.text =element_text(size=12),\n        plot.title.position = \"plot\",\n        legend.text =element_text(size=11),\n        legend.title =element_text(size=14,face=\"bold\"),\n        strip.text=element_text(size=14,face=\"italic\"),\n        plot.caption = element_text(size = 9, hjust = 3)\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter a strong freshman year, Paige Bueckers faced considerable setbacks with back-to-back injuries that impacted her sophomore year and kept her sidelined for the entire 2022-23 season. However Bueckers returned to have a great senior year, posting some of the best numbers. Her assists similarly equaled that of Clark’s sophomore year, while her total rebounds were the highest of all the seasons she played. This is a remarkable return after a year off and underlines not only her resilience but also how she can quickly regain her form and continue at an elite level, matching or bettering her previous performances in key areas.\nIn all, Caitlin Clark’s totals over the seasons reflect a consistent rise in almost every stat. From freshman year to senior, she made big jumps in almost every stat. Her steals remained consistent from 2021-22 to the 2022-23 season, with slight increase in her senior year, which really shows she can keep up her defensive impact. Clark’s ability to elevate all areas of her game, year after year, solidified her role as a dominant force on the court, where noticeable increases in both scoring and playmaking were present.\n\n\nAnalyzing the Correlation of Key Performance Metrics\nLastly, I am comparing three key performance metrics: Points Per Game, Shooting Efficiency, and Total Rebounds. Analyzing the relationship between these stats is crucial for understanding how effectively each player is able to generate points while maintaining efficiency. This comparison not only highlights their scoring abilities, but also provides insight into who is able to contribute more consistently across different aspects of the game. With the bubble size representing total rebounds, it offers a visual representation of how each player’s rebounds correlate with their scoring and efficiency.\n\n\nCode\nggplot(pc,aes(x=PTS,y=FG.,size=TRB,color=Player))+\n  geom_point(alpha=.6)+\n  scale_size_continuous(range=c(2,6))+\n  labs(\n    x=\"Points Per Game(PPG)\",\n    y=\"Shooting Efficiency(FG%)\",\n    title=\"Bueckers’ Higher Efficiency Outshines Clark’s Scoring Surge\",\n    subtitle=\"Bueckers focused on refining her shooting accuracy, whereas Clark boosted her points per game.\",\n    caption=\"Source: https://www.sports-reference.com | By: Aliscyn Hammond\"\n  )+\n  scale_color_manual(values=c(\"Paige Bueckers\" =\"#e4002b\",\n                              \"Caitlin Clark\"=\"#FFCD00\"))+\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 14, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 11, face = \"italic\"),\n    axis.title.x = element_text(size = 11),\n    axis.title.y = element_text(size = 11),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\",\n    axis.text.x = element_text(size = 10, hjust = 1),\n    axis.text.y = element_text(size = 10),\n    legend.title = element_text(size = 12, face = \"bold\"),\n    legend.text = element_text(size = 12),\n    plot.caption = element_text(size = 9, hjust = 2.3)\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaitlin Clark leads in points per game, while having a slightly lower shooting efficiency than Bueckers. Her scoring consistency is evident, as she was able to put impressive numbers year after year, even with a more stable stable shooting efficiency. Clark’s total rebounds also show a larger range compared to Paige’s, which evidences her capability to contribute in multiple areas of the game. While her shooting efficiency remains relatively steady, Caitlin’s scoring prowess and rebounding versatility show her aptitude to impact the game in a broader sense. That balance of scoring and rebounds alone gives her a distinct edge over others in overall contributions.\nPaige Bueckers presents an interesting case in this comparison, as she demonstrated significantly higher shooting efficiency than Caitlin Clark. While scoring fewer points per game, her efficiency stands out, especially considering she had a season off and missed games due to injuries. That is really interesting because, even though Bueckers’ setback occurred well into her career, she still maintains a shooting percentage above Clark’s. In terms of that ability to be on the floor and scoring efficiently, she scored much more. This contrast in scoring and efficiency reflects how Paige’s shot selection and execution have allowed her to make the most of her opportunities, even if her overall points per game isn’t as high as Clark’s.\nAfter analyzing all the data and reflecting on the growth of both Caitlin Clark and Paige Bueckers, it’s clear that Caitlin has developed as expected over a full-four year college career and she did even better than the average with showing impressive consistency and improvement in nearly every area. However, what stands out the most to me is Paige Bueckers’ remarkable growth, especially considering the setbacks she faced. Her time off the game in injury could have stalled her career, but she made a strong comeback, one that showed not just the resilience of a girl who had been down, but also how sure she was of her game. If Paige could play her junior year, I really believe she would be mentioned right alongside Caitlin Clark and maybe even compete for an early draft eligibility. Such great shooting this season, which included an over-80% game, speaks volumes about being able to bounce back and still perform at an elite level. I believe that while Caitlin Clark has been tremendous all season and has warranted so much attention in scoring and overall performances, it’s Paige’s journey and her growth that deserve more discussion. But with those major setbacks and a non-full, four year collegiate career, her performance and potential really show just how much of an impact she’s made in such a short amount of time. I am interested to see how she ends up doing this season since she has been in the media’s eyes for awhile and her comeback was already powerful. Just imagine how good she can be after being able to practice without worrying about the progress of her recovery."

    "text": "The Importance of Assists in Women’s Basketball\nIn women’s basketball, like any sport, teamwork is an essential part of the sport. A team’s ability to share the ball, provide teammates with opportunities, and maintains offensive flow. If a team has a high assist total, it generally indicates that a team can communicates effectively, which leads to better offensive execution and higher percentage shots. With examining the data, we can evaluate if there is a relationship between a team’s ultimate score and amount of assists they produce and find any trends.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse) \nlibrary(ggplot2)\nelite&lt;-read.csv(\"dataproject/2024_elite_eight_wbb.csv\")\n\nselected_teams &lt;- c(\"SC\", \"ORST\", \"TEX\", \"NCSU\", \"IOWA\", \"LSU\", \"CONN\", \"USC\")\n\nelite_eight &lt;- elite[elite$team_abbreviation %in% selected_teams, ]\n\nggplot(elite_eight, aes(x = assists, y = team_score, color = team_winner)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.7, size = 3) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"TRUE\" = \"royalblue3\", \"FALSE\" = \"deeppink\"),\n  labels=c(\"TRUE\"=\"Win\",\"FALSE\"=\"Loss\")\n  ) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Does Playmaking Drive Wins in the 2024 Women's Elite Eight?\",\n    subtitle = \"Higher assists generally lead to wins, though some teams with high assists still lose.\",\n    x = \"Assists\",\n    y = \"Team Score\",\n    caption = \"By: Aliscyn Hammond | Source: wehoop\",\n    color = \"Team Outcome\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = ggtext::element_markdown(size = 12, lineheight = 1.2, hjust = 0.5),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 14,face=\"bold\"),\n    axis.text = element_text(size = 12),\n    plot.caption = element_text(size = 10, hjust = 1),\n    legend.position = \"top\",  \n    legend.title = element_text(size = 10,face=\"bold\"),\n    legend.text = element_text(size = 10)\n  ) +\n  theme(panel.grid.major = element_line(color = \"gray\", size = 0.5),\n        panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n          plot.title.position = \"plot\")+\n  scale_y_continuous(limits=c(50,100))+\n   scale_x_continuous(limits = c(min(elite_eight$assists), max(elite_eight$assists)))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe scatterplot visualizes the relationship between the Elite Eight teams’ final scores and the number of assists they recorded in the 2024 NCAA Women’s Basketball Tournament. While there is a general upward trend indicating that teams with more assists tend to score higher, the plot also reveals variability. Notably, some teams recorded high assist numbers, but still lost the game, while others with fewer assists managed to secure a win.\nThe variability suggests that while assists can be important for offensive success, they are not the sole determinant of the game’s outcome. That is where other outcome’s come into play, such as shooting efficiency, turnovers, or defense. The trend still suggests that strong teamwork and ball movement, as indicated by higher assist totals, often correlate with winning."

Notably, Iowa and NC State were the only two teams that had fewer assists in their winning games compared to their losing games.\nWhile winning teams generally had higher average assist total, there wasn’t a clear, direct correlation between assists and victory. Some teams with high assists still lost, suggesting that assists alone do not guarantee success.

    "section": "Assists Distribution: A More Deeper Look into Variability",
    "text": "Assists Distribution: A More Deeper Look into Variability\nNow let’s explore the distribution of assists among winning and losing teams in greater detail. Instead of merely focusing on the averages, we can analyze the spread of assists within each team to better understand variability. Do winning teams consistently excel at ball distribution, or do their assist figures fluctuate more than anticipated? To help us understand this, we will use a boxplot, which will show us the range of assists for both winning and losing teams. Using this will highlight where most teams fall in terms of assists, as well as show any outliers—teams with unusually high or low assist numbers. The distribution of assists and whether there is a discernible difference between winning and losing teams will be more clear.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nggplot(elite_eight, aes(x = factor(team_winner, labels = c(\"Loss\", \"Win\")), y = assists, fill = team_winner)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  labs(title = \"Dissecting the Assist Gap\",\n       subtitle = \"A look at how success and struggle play out on the court.\",\n       x = \"Team Status\",\n       y = \"Assists\",\n       caption = \"By: Aliscyn Hammond | Source: wehoop\") +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"deeppink\", \"royalblue3\"),\n                    name= \"Team Score\",\n                    labels=c(\"Loss\",\"Win\")\n                    ) +\n  theme_minimal()+\n  theme(\n       plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 22),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 14),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 16,face=\"bold\"),                 \n    axis.text = element_text(size = 12),\n    plot.caption= element_text(size=10,hjust=1),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs it shows, there are differences in distribution. Winning teams tend to have a smaller, more tightly grouped range of assists, which is positioned higher on the scale of assists compared to the losing teams. The median of the winning teams is closer to the top of the box, while the median of the losing teams is more centered, indicating that winning teams generally record higher assists. Also, the shorter “stems” for the winning teams suggest that most winning teams have a more consistent level of assists, while the longer “stems of the losing teams imply a greater spread in assist values, with some losing teams recording unusually high assists. Given this, the variability in assists among losing teams highlights that assists alone are not enough to ensure victory, suggesting that other factors more than likely influence the outcome of a game.\nWhile assists are a vital part of basketball and correlate with team scoring, they do not guarantee victory. Some losing teams record high assists, indicating the ball movement alone is not enough to win. The variability we have seen shows that the assist distribution of both winning and losing teams suggesting that winning is determined by broader set of factors, including but not limited to, shooting accuracy, turnovers, defense, and ability to execute under pressure. The analysis of assists in the 2024 Women’s Elite Eight provides a glimpse into how team play influences game outcomes, but it also reinforces the idea that basketball is a multi-faceted sport. Success on the court depends not just on assists, but on all variety of elements working together. By exploring additional data and using statistical techniques, anyone can gain a deeper understanding of the complex nature of sport performance and truly find the true drivers of success."
