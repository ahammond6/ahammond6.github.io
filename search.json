    "section": "",
    "text": "Whether a team’s ultimate score in the Elite Eight is correlated with the amount of assists they record is a subject that coaches,fans, and analysts alike are asking asking as the 2024 NCAA Women’s Basketball Tournament approaches its end. Assists have a reputation as indicators of a good team play and offensive cooperation, but how do they relate to the outcome of games at such a high level of competition? We will explore the relationship between assists and final score, compare winning teams’ assists with losing teams, and find the distribution of assists for winning and losing teams.\nThe Importance of Assists in Women’s Basketball\nIn women’s basketball, like any sport, teamwork is an essential part of the sport. A team’s ability to share the ball, provide teammates with opportunities, and maintains offensive flow. If a team has a high assist total, it generally indicates that a team is communicates effectively, which leads to better offensive execution and higher percentage shots.With examining the data, we can evaluate if there is a relationship between a team’s ultimate score and amount of assists they produce and find any trends.\n\nlibrary(tidyverse) \nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nelite &lt;- read.csv(\"C:/Users/alisc/OneDrive/Documents/Desktop/blog/aliscynSportBlog/posts/elite-eight-women-basketball/2024_elite_eight_wbb.csv\")\n\neliteclean &lt;- elite[,c(\"game_id\",\"team_name\",\"team_score\",\"assists\",\"team_winner\")]\n\nggplot(eliteclean,aes(x=assists,y=team_score,color=team_winner))+\n  geom_point()+\n  geom_smooth(method='lm',color='red',linetype=\"dashed\",se=FALSE)+\n  labs(title=\"Relationship Between Assists and Final Score in the 2024 Women's Elite Eight\",\n       x=\"Assists\",\n       y=\"Team Score\",\n       caption= \"By: Aliscyn Hammond | Source: 2024 Women's Elite Eight\")+\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe scatterplot displays the relationship between the teams’ final scores and the number of assists they received in the 2024 Women’s Elite Eight. While there is a general upward trend indicating that teams with more assists score higher, the plot also reveals variability, with some teams having high assists numbers yet failing to score well.\nHow Do Winning Teams Compare to Losing Teams in Assists?\nWe may then contrast the average number of assists scored by winning and losing teams. It may indicate that winning teams are more proficient at providing opportunities for one another, which results in more effective scoring, if they have greater average assist totals.\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nelite &lt;- read.csv(\"C:/Users/alisc/OneDrive/Documents/Desktop/blog/aliscynSportBlog/posts/elite-eight-women-basketball/2024_elite_eight_wbb.csv\")\n\navg_assists &lt;- elite |&gt;\n  group_by(team_winner) |&gt;\n  summarise(avg_assists=mean(assists,na.rm=TRUE))\nelite &lt;- elite %&gt;%\n  mutate(team_status = ifelse(team_winner == TRUE, \"Winning\", \"Losing\"))\n\nggplot(elite, aes(x = team_display_name, y = assists, fill = team_status)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", show.legend = FALSE) +  \n  geom_hline(data = avg_assists, aes(yintercept = avg_assists, color = factor(team_winner)), linetype = \"dashed\", size = 1,color=\"black\") +  \n  labs(\n    title = \"Assists per Team in the 2024 Women's Elite Eight\",\n    subtitle = paste(\"Black dashed lines show average assists for Winning and Losing Teams.\"),\n    x = \"Team\",\n    y = \"Assists\",\n    caption = \"By: Aliscyn Hammond | Source: 2024 Women's Elite Eight Dataset\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"green\", \"red\")) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"green\", \"red\")) +  \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 12, face = \"italic\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 12, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1, size = 10),  \n    axis.text.y = element_text(size = 10),\n    panel.grid = element_blank()  \n  )\n\nWarning: Using `size` aesthetic for lines was deprecated in ggplot2 3.4.0.\nℹ Please use `linewidth` instead.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile winning teams generally had higher average assists, there wasn’t a clear correlation between assists and victory. Some teams with high assists still lost, showing that assists alone do not ensure success.Assists are important for creating scoring opportunities which benefit the team, but do not guarantee that those opportunities will get converted into points. For example, if a team struggles with shooting accuracy or commit turnovers, their high assists might not translate into a win which is why we see some lack thereof in teams that have high assists, but lost. Conversely, some teams that won with fewer assists may have relied heavily on individual performances or a strong defense, which allowed them to overcome their lower assist totals.\nAssists Distribution: A More Deeper Look into Variability"
