    "text": "Whether a team’s ultimate score in the Elite Eight is correlated with the amount of assists they record is a subject that coaches,fans, and analysts alike are asking asking as the 2024 NCAA Women’s Basketball Tournament approaches its end. Assists have a reputation as indicators of a good team play and offensive cooperation, but how do they relate to the outcome of games at such a high level of competition? We will explore the relationship between assists and final score, compare winning teams’ assists with losing teams, and find the distribution of assists for winning and losing teams.\nThe Importance of Assists in Women’s Basketball\nIn women’s basketball, like any sport, teamwork is an essential part of the sport. A team’s ability to share the ball, provide teammates with opportunities, and maintains offensive flow. If a team has a high assist total, it generally indicates that a team is communicates effectively, which leads to better offensive execution and higher percentage shots.With examining the data, we can evaluate if there is a relationship between a team’s ultimate score and amount of assists they produce and find any trends.\n\nlibrary(tidyverse) \nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nelite &lt;- read.csv(\"C:/Users/alisc/OneDrive/Documents/Desktop/blog/aliscynSportBlog/posts/elite-eight-women-basketball/2024_elite_eight_wbb.csv\")\n\neliteclean &lt;- elite[,c(\"game_id\",\"team_name\",\"team_score\",\"assists\",\"team_winner\")]\n\nggplot(eliteclean,aes(x=assists,y=team_score,color=team_winner))+\n  geom_point()+\n  geom_smooth(method='lm',color='red',linetype=\"dashed\",se=FALSE)+\n  labs(title=\"Relationship Between Assists and Final Score in the 2024 Women's Elite Eight\",\n       x=\"Assists\",\n       y=\"Team Score\",\n       caption= \"By: Aliscyn Hammond | Source: 2024 Women's Elite Eight\")+\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe scatterplot displays the relationship between the teams’ final scores and the number of assists they received in the 2024 Women’s Elite Eight. While there is a general upward trend indicating that teams with more assists score higher, the plot also reveals variability, with some teams having high assists numbers yet failing to score well.\nHow Do Winning Teams Compare to Losing Teams in Assists?\nWe may then contrast the average number of assists scored by winning and losing teams. It may indicate that winning teams are more proficient at providing opportunities for one another, which results in more effective scoring, if they have greater average assist totals.\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nelite &lt;- read.csv(\"C:/Users/alisc/OneDrive/Documents/Desktop/blog/aliscynSportBlog/posts/elite-eight-women-basketball/2024_elite_eight_wbb.csv\")\n\navg_assists &lt;- elite |&gt;\n  group_by(team_winner) |&gt;\n  summarise(avg_assists=mean(assists,na.rm=TRUE))\nelite &lt;- elite %&gt;%\n  mutate(team_status = ifelse(team_winner == TRUE, \"Winning\", \"Losing\"))"
